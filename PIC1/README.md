# BusinessModel
This business model is a proposition project to solve a specific problem

We had identify the needed that some factories had when they are processing their products,
many of them are so fragile and/or delicate, then we propose a conveyor belt.
It will be very precise thanks to stepper motors that rotate the belt, and we will control his direction with a matricial keyboard, 
also have some leds who indicate his functionality, and sensors to diference the  item who it's transport and some details.
